## Project Overview

"Anime Watch" is a web application that allows users to explore a vast collection of anime, view details about each anime, and later watch them. This project combines the power of modern web technologies, including Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and React, to deliver a seamless and engaging anime-watching experience.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that serves your code via native ES modules.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.


### Getting started

Before you get started with the "Anime Watch" project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Make sure you have Node.js installed, as it is required to run the project's server and build scripts.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): npm is the package manager for Node.js. It comes bundled with Node.js, so you should have it installed already.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): This project utilizes Vite as the development tool and build system. 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You don't need to install it globally; it's included in the project's dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshheavy/yAnimeWatch.git

2. npm install

    This command will start the development server using Vite. By default, you can access the application at http://localhost:5173.
